This is a sample restaurant page done for the Odin Project.

The entire page is built using javascript, CSS, and utlizing webpack. There is no HTML written aside from a div with the id of 'content.'

The purpose of this project is to show DOM manipulation using nothing but Javascript and also to utilize webpack.
