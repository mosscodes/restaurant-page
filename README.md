This is a sample restaurant page done for the Odin Project.

The entire page is built using javascript, CSS, and utlizing webpack. There is no HTML written aside from a div with the id of 'content.'

The purpose of this project is to show DOM manipulation using nothing but Javascript and also to utilize webpack.

The website is styled with Google Chrome in mind. Please use Google Chrome when viewing the page. 

I may go back and restyle for FireFox at a later date.
